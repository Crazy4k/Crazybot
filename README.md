# Crazybot
Crazybot is a general discord bot that is capable of operating a discord server.

This is my very first Javascript project so giving me any type of feedback would be extremely helpful.


## How to activate

If you want to turn on this bot, follow there steps:
1. Install vs code
2. Install node.js
3. Open the code with vsc
4. Creat a .env file and create a var called "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN" and give the value of a bot token
5. Open the terminal(mine was powershell)
6. Type "npm i" in the terminal and wai a minute
7. Type "node ./index.js" or "node ." in the termianl

### If you want the points plugin to work perfectly:
1. create a MongoDB account
2. Create a cluster
3. inside your .env folder, creat a config var "MONGO_PATH" and give it the value of the mongoBD cluster connection link
