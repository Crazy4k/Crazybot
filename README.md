# Crazybot
A discord bot that used to my discord server (now dead). This is also my first Javascript project. Feel free to take the code and put it in your discord.js bot. The code still has a lot of bugs in it and the server it was in died so there was no need to fix them in the first place. This bot now operates my friend's server "Department of defense" and now it's currently being used.

If you have anything you want to discuss with me, hit me up on discord: Crazy4k#0091

If you want to turn on this bot, follow there steps:
1- sinstall vs code
2- install node.js
3- open the code with vsc
4- go to "config.json" and change the token to yours
5- open the terminal(mine was powershell)
6- type "npm i" in the terminal and wai a minute
7- type "node ./index.js" or "node ." in the termianl
