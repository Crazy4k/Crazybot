# Crazybot
A discord bot that used to my discord server (now dead). This is also my first Javascript project. Feel free to take the code and put it in your discord.js bot. The code still has a lot of bugs in it and the server it was in died so there was no need to fix them in the first place. I might come back to this some time if i need to but until then it is full of insects 🐜🐜🐜.

If you want to turn on this bot, follow there steps:
1- sinstall vs code
2- install node.js
3- open the code with vsc
4- go to "config.json" and change the token to yours
5- open the terminal(mine was powershell)
6- type "npm i" in the terminal and wai a minute
7- type "node ./index.js" or "node ." in the termianl
